# Lanelet2 Map of Morton for conversion to Apollo HDMap format

This map is a subset of the `Morton Full` map, it only contains enough lanelets to be converted into Apollo HDMap successfully.
The duplication in the `Morton Full` map throws off the converter, so only manually-edited portions of the map are saved here.

**Note:** Some elements of the map are not guaranteed to be accurate (especially stop sign and traffic light locations). Use at your own risk.
