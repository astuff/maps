# Lanelet2 Map of Area X.O

This map covers part of the [Area X.O](https://areaxo.com) test facility.
It was created by hand in [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de) based off of gnss traces from a NovAtel PwrPak7D-E2 with RTK corrections from a local base station.

Since this map is used with Autoware.AI, it also contains tags for the [Autoware.AI Lanelet2 Extensions](https://github.com/Autoware-AI/common/blob/master/lanelet2_extension/docs/lanelet2_format_extension.md).

If you wish to make updates to the map, it is suggested to first read the [Lanelet2 map editing docs](https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/Lanelet2/tree/master/lanelet2_maps).

**Note:** Some elements of the map are not guaranteed to be accurate (especially stop sign and traffic light locations). Use at your own risk.
